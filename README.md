# NexLearn  
**Make-a-ton 7.0 — Where Learning Becomes an Adventure** 🎲🗺️⚔️

## ✨ Inspiration
We asked ourselves: *"What if school felt more like Dungeons & Dragons and less like… well, school?"*  
Thus, **NexLearn** was born — an epic fusion of **adventure gaming** and **AI wizardry**. Our quest?  
Turn every boring lesson into a legendary quest where the final boss is ignorance itself.

## 🪄 What It Does
NexLearn is your **AI-powered, game-based learning sidekick**. It takes your study materials, sprinkles in some storytelling magic, and sends you on personalized learning adventures where your decisions shape the plot *and* your knowledge.

Here’s your party’s toolkit:
- 🗡 **AI-generated interactive storytelling**: Think *Dungeons & Dragons*, but your choices decide both the fate of the kingdom and your grade.
- 📚 **Document-based chatbot**: Upload your notes, textbooks, or secret scrolls — then chat with them like they’re your wise mentor.
- 🎥 **AI prompt-to-video converter**: Turn AI-generated prompts into explainer videos so you can finally understand quantum physics without crying.

## ⚙️ How We Built It
Like any good RPG, it took a diverse party of heroes:
- **Backend sorcery**: Flask to manage quests (data) and handle player actions.
- **Frontend wizardry**: React to make it as smooth and shiny as a +5 Sword of Responsiveness.
- **AI familiars**: Models like Gemini to weave adaptive storylines and plot twists based on your every move.
  
We tied it all together so your learning journey adapts to *you*, making each run unique — like speedrunning a course with plot armor.
