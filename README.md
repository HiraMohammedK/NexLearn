# NexLearn
Make-a-ton-7.0
* Inspiration
The idea for Nexlearn was inspired by the engaging and immersive world of adventure games, particularly Dungeons and Dragons. We wanted to blend the excitement of these narrative-driven experiences with the power of AI to create a learning platform that makes education fun and interactive. Our goal was to transform traditional learning methods into an epic adventure, making the journey as enjoyable as the destination.

* What it does
Nexlearn is an interactive educational platform that combines game-based learning with AI-driven tools. Users embark on personalized adventures where their decisions influence the story, reinforcing educational content. The platform includes:

 -An AI-generated interactive storytelling game inspired by Dungeons and Dragons.
 -A document-based chatbot for content interaction, allowing users to upload and engage with their learning materials.
 -An AI prompt-to-video converter that transforms AI-generated prompts into visual explanations, helping users better grasp concepts.
 
* How we built it
Nexlearn was developed using Flask for the backend to handle data management and user interactions, while React powers the dynamic and responsive frontend. The platform integrates AI models like the Gemini model to craft interactive and contextually relevant storylines. We combined these technologies to ensure smooth interactivity, personalized learning paths, and adaptive storytelling based on user inputs.
